There are several limitations to the current system. One is that when questions that contain words that do not exist in Lexicon are asked, the system fails parsing but ends up returning “Eh??”. I suggest that the system returns better responses. If the question starts with “Which” then the system could return “None” and if the question begins with “Who” then the system could return “No one”. This is easy to implement as checking if the question starts with “Who” or “Which” and simply changing expected output will do. The system also can be improved by being able to handle simple negation so that questions like “Which is not a dog?” can be asked and answered. It is not difficult to implement this because adding several more rules to the semantics and to the grammar will do. Moreover, if we add more rules to the grammar and the semantics, we can enable YES/NO questions like “Is Benjamin a boy?” and therefore improve the system by enabling it to ask a more variety of questions.
